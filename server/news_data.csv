The Aussies have so far have been outplayed twice and accommodate the bottom position on the points table. Sri Lanka too are yet to open their account but due to a superior run-rate are placed two spots higher than the Aussies. Australia head into the contest after enduring a tough 134-run defeat against South Africa and prior to that they had endured a six-wicket defeat against India. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, engaged in a high-scoring encounter against South Africa, which they lost by 102 runs. Pakistan then chased down a stiff 345 against them in their second match. If we compare both the sides, Australia appear more formidable and will enter the contest as favourites. The team is filled with promising players but their key spinner Adam Zampa has so far been ineffective, a major reason behind their poor outing. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will be without their captain Dasun Shanaka, who has been ruled out of World Cup due to a thigh injury. Sri Lanka have roped in Chamika Karunaratne as his replacement in the squad. The major concern for Sri Lanka has been their bowling.

Chanakya National Law University, Patna.(File photo) Talking to media on Sunday, Hussain, who was the VC of NALSAR University of Law for a decade and was the founder VC of National Law University, Odisha, said he would like to make the institution student-centric and do “some aggressive surgery” for its development as a centre of excellence in the true sense. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. “I have met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar twice and the Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, who is the CNLU Chancellor, four times since taking over and both of them want things to improve to bring it at par with the best in the country. In fact, the CM told me CNLU was his dream project. I have been brought for the purpose of revamping it. I have been holding open sessions with the students to take their issues to the academic council, which was held last week and a lot of changes are on the anvil as per students’ demand,” he added. Maintaining that academic flexibility was the need of the hour and also a key thing in the New Education Policy (NEP), which Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wants, Hussain said that he had started it at NALSAR in 2012 itself and it had helped bring down the stress level of the students significantly. With the students unable to cope with growing stress level, a lot of unsavoury incidents have been reported from Kota as well as famed institutions, he added. The VC has also written to the government for additional seven-acre land for CNLU, as had been planned at the time of its inception in 2006 and also met the.CM in this regard. “We have decided to bring down the requirement of research papers in a year from 12 to one and incorporate new elements instead, as the students also aired their grievances about too much pressure. We have all kinds of students and the system should be convenient for all. We are also developing Accessibility lab for visually-impaired students and making al the classrooms digital at a cost of ₹ 7-crore,” he added. He said that the emphasis would be on integration of knowledge and more research by incentivising published work and financial benefits on research projects. “We also plan to start a community radio at the CNLU to reach out to the masses for greater legal awareness. We are also planning to start new courses in cyber security & digital forensics, land law, taxation law, corporate & competition law etc., Cyber security & digital forensics centre will train the police force, as it is mandated to have one trained personnel in every police station under the new Nageik Suraksha Bill, 2023. In cyber crime, the conviction rate in India is just 3.5%, while the magnitude of crime is rising at a huge speed,” he added. Before joining CNLU on August 3, Hussain was at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh and is the recipient of both Commonwealth Scholarship as well as Fulbright Fellowship. He was conferred on the SAARC’s ‘Best Law Teacher Award’ in 2014. He has delivered lectures in almost 32 countries of the world like USA, UK, Australia, Germany, China, Germany, Israel etc. He also runs the popular Youtube channel namely Legal Awareness WebSeries. “My effort is to align the university to the needs of the students. Therefore, I not only engage classes, but also sit in others’ lectures. From day one, I have asked the students that they can meet me freely. The students raised the issue of lack of specialist teachers and the academic council has approved induction of new teachers. ""Exciting news!

Biden calls for unity against Islamophobia and bigotry after murder of child(AP/ FIle/Council on AmericanIslamic Relations) On Saturday, a 71-year-old man stabbed a 6-year-old boy to death and wounded his mother in a hate crime motivated by their Muslim faith and the war between Israel and Hamas, according to police.

The child’s Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek—a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace. “This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are,” Biden said in a statement.

We must be unequivocal. There is no place in America for hate against anyone,” he said. He offered his condolences and prayers to the family, including for the mother’s recovery, and to the broader Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities. The suspect, Joseph Czuba, was the landlord of the victims, who lived on the ground floor of his home in Plainfield Township, Ill. On Saturday morning, he allegedly knocked on their door and attacked them with a large military-style knife, shouting, “You Muslims must die!” at them, as the boy’s father learned from text messages. The boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American who had recently celebrated his sixth birthday, died from 26 stab wounds, while his mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, survived with more than a dozen stab wounds. She was in critical condition but expected to recover. Will County sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene and found Czuba sitting in front of the home with a cut on his forehead. He was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment. “Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Chicago chapter (CAIR-Chicago) condemned the violence and said it was part of a disturbing increase in hate crimes against Muslims after Hamas’ attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent declaration of war.

Czuba was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. He is currently being held at the Will County’s Adult Detention facility. ""Exciting news!

To navigate this olfactory journey, Midday sat down with seasoned perfumers who shed light on the nuances of selecting the perfect fragrance","Key Highlights Share: From earthy scents to zesty aromas, the world of perfumery offers extensive options Some gravitate towards the warm, comforting fragrances, others might prefer lively tones How do you determine which scent truly resonates with you? Read to find out In a world where fragrance has the power to evoke emotions, choosing the right one can be daunting. From earthy scents to zesty aromas, the offers an extensive array of fragrances. The subtleties of personal preference, occasion and season can all play a significant role in the selection process, adding to the complexity of the decision. Some may gravitate towards the warm, comforting embrace of woody fragrances, while others might prefer the lively and uplifting tones of citrus scents. While some may find themselves captivated by the sweet, fruity notes that whisk them away to far-off orchards. In the midst of this aromatic abundance, the question arises: How do you determine which scent truly resonates with you? Fret not. There is a way to select the fragrance that perfectly complements your personality, style and mood. To navigate this olfactory journey, Midday sat down with experienced perfumers – Ridhima Kansal and Vidushi Vijayvergiya, who shed light on the nuances of selecting the . “There are innumerable fragrance profiles made from a mix of natural elements and synthesised molecules. A perfumer generally works with around 2,000 different ingredients while developing fragrances. Based on the brief, we blend ingredients to present the idea in a harmonious way,” remarks Vidushi Vijayvergiya, the founder and CEO of ISAK Fragrances. Fragrances are divided into several main families, each with a unique scent and distinct combination. Ridhima Kansal, the director of the UK-based home fragrance brand – Rosemoore, shares major fragrance groups along with their characteristics. Floral: This category refers to the fragrance of freshly plucked flowers. For instance: Rose, Jasmine, Gardenia, Lily and more. Fruity: Fruity fragrance is derived from the aroma of fruits including berries, peaches and apples. Lively and playful, these scents add a youthful touch to the wearer. Spicy: This consists of warm, aromatic ingredients like nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s usually worn in colder seasons to exude warmth and fragrance. Citrusy: This is dominated by zesty and refreshing citrus fruits like lemon, orange and grapefruit which not only uplifts the mood but creates a fresh ambiance. Woody: This family contains earthy, woody scents like vetiver, sandalwood and cedarwood which evoke a sense of ambient nature that is soothing to the senses. These fragrance families provide a system for classifying fragrances based on their core characteristics, but they blend many contemporary fragrances, incorporating elements from different categories to create unique and multifaceted olfactory experiences. Kansal reveals the one should opt for, depending upon the season. For spring and summer seasons – fresh, especially flowery or citrus fragrances are best. These scents produce a positive mood by capturing the liveliness and vibrancy of these seasons. In the winter season – warm, spicy and woody fragrances are preferable as they induce a soothing and inviting aura that pairs well with the chilly weather. The season and weather play an important role in determining the fragrance one intends to wear, remarks Vijayvergia. “As per Indian heritage and Vedas, we should use cooling and fresh ingredients-based perfumes during the summers. Some such ingredients are Vetiver, rose, rajnigandha, sandalwood and mitti. During winters – we can go for warmer/woody fragrances with notes like amber, Oudh, Vanilla, Resins and Patchouli.” Based on the type of occasion, one can decide the relevant fragrance to wear. For an office day, wear subtle perfumes that are also fresh and long-lasting: Patchouli, Sandalwood and Cedarwood. These sophisticated, earthy scents are appropriate for both formal and informal settings since they exude a feeling of grounding and elegance. Vijayvergia advises against wearing strong Oudh-focused perfumes to the office. Although, a strong Oudh-based perfume could be a great extension of one’s personality as an evening party wear. Additionally, citrus and floral perfumes are suitable for fun dates, adventure activities and day picnics. Apple, mango, and blackberry are fruity scents that are playful and young-smelling, adding an energising touch and making them ideal for daytime wear. Rose, jasmine, and lavender are floral. These timeless, enduring scents are preferred for special occasions or private situations because they radiate elegance and passion. These notes help uplift our moods with sublime fragrance profiles and induce faint wellness. The role of layering to sustain the fragrance We all crave a long-lasting fragrance but generally don’t end up with one. Perfumers share tricks to sustain the aroma with handy tips. “As a general rule of thumb, heavier scents like woody should be sprayed first so they don’t overpower their lighter counterparts like citruses,” shares Vijayvergia. Always apply fragrances on pulse points like the wrist, neck, etc., and allow it some time to develop and settle down. Keep noticing how it changes and interacts with the odour of your skin. The concentration of fragrance is directly proportional to longevity. Hence, for a long-lasting fragrance, choose a higher-concentration fragrance. Also, using scents on well-moisturised skin enhances the longevity of the fragrance because of the hydrated base to which the scent adheres. Layering scents can do wonders. Apply a non-scented moisturiser after shower and then spray your preferred perfumes. Or, you can spray one scent on your wrists and another on your neck. Play around with different combinations and don’t be afraid to experiment. To enhance longevity and create a multi-dimensional fragrance sensation, use complementary scented items like shower gel and lotion, adds Kansal. Layering complementary fragrances like floral and citrus will help you create a unique and individualised perfume that will reflect your personality and style. There are a few ways you can approach layering. The easiest is to find a fairly unfussy fragrance that is already built around musk or typical base notes like vanilla. Add to it, something with more complexity on top to create an appealing mix. Another option is to use a single-note perfume under or over an existing scent. A fragrance contains many key components that interact in harmony to create a unique and memorable fragrance. Key features include: Top notes: The first, volatile scents that are perceived upon application Heart (Middle) notes: After the disappearance of top notes, heart notes form the core of the fragrance. Base notes: Deep, long-lasting scents that emerge after the heart notes and serve to anchor the fragrance. The interaction of these elements and part of their blend, determines the fragrance’s unique olfactory experience. Top notes draw, heart notes define, and base notes linger, creating a multi-dimensional and evolving fragrance that makes each fragrance unique. Picking a fragrance depends on one’s personal style and the occasion – formal, informal or casual. Additionally, skin type and pH balance are other factors that influence how a scent interacts with one’s skin and affects its development and longevity, shares Kansal. Therefore, selecting scents requires an understanding of your skin. Here are some guidelines to help you choose the most suitable fragrance according to your skin type: If you have normal skin, you're in luck because most fragrances tend to work well on your skin. You have the flexibility to choose a wide range of scents, from light and fresh to rich and complex. Floral, fruity, woody and citrus fragrances should all work harmoniously with your skin type. Dry skin has less natural moisture, which can cause fragrances to evaporate more quickly. Opt for fragrances with richer, oil-based formulations such as perfume oils, Eau de Parfum (EDP) or parfum concentrations. Woody and oriental scents with deeper, lingering notes can work well with dry skin, as they tend to last longer. Oily skin tends to retain fragrances longer, which means you may not need as much or as heavy a fragrance. Light, fresh and citrusy scents are great choices to counterbalance the natural oiliness of your skin. Eau de Toilette (EDT) or lighter concentrations can work well for oily skin types. Sensitive skin can sometimes react to fragrances due to the alcohol or other ingredients in perfumes. It's advisable to choose fragrance-free or hypoallergenic options. If you still want to wear scents, consider applying a minimal amount of a fragrance-free moisturiser or unscented body oil to create a barrier between your skin and the perfume. If your skin is a combination of oily and dry areas, consider applying a fragrance-neutral moisturiser to balance out the skin's moisture levels before applying your perfume. This will help the fragrance distribute more evenly and last longer. As skin ages, it tends to become drier. Opt for fragrances with heavier, richer bases such as woody, oriental or gourmand scents, as they can work well with ageing skin. Perfume oils and Eau de Parfum (EDP) are excellent choices for a longer-lasting scent. It’s important to consider the pH balance of one's skin when choosing a fragrance because it’s directly linked with the impact on how a fragrance reacts with your skin. Testing fragrance on your inner elbow or wrist will help you determine compatibility. Harmonious balance can be ensured by using testers or samples which will help determine how a fragrance interacts with your particular skin chemistry. Identifying your favourite scent, often referred to as your ""scent personality,"" can be a fun and personal journey. Here are some ways shared by the perfumers to find your preference: 1. Try different fragrance categories to find which one appeals the most. Pay attention to the emotional response each aroma evokes. 2. Try the perfume on scent strips. Once shortlisted, try the fragrance on our skin. Specifically, at the pulse points. This will help you understand how the perfume will smell on you. 3. Think about the fragrance in common items like soaps or lotions that you naturally prefer. Finding your signature perfume can be done by starting with these preferences. 4. Think about any memory or emotion that you associate with a specific fragrance. Often some fragrances that bring back cherished memories match your fragrance characteristics. 5. There are multiple quizzes that are based on the science of synaesthesia (the production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the body). One can take a perfume quiz online to find their scent profile. Vijayvergiya shares a connection between one’s personality and fragrance profile: “If your radiant energy, high spirits and a heart of gold reveal your inner beauty – your right brain is devoted to soft lines and natural colours. Floral and fruity perfumes are not only your favourite but they also enhance your virtuosity and loveliness.” Remember, there are no rights or wrongs when it comes to fragrance. Your scent personality is a unique reflection of your own tastes and experiences, so embrace the scent that makes you feel good.",16-10-2023 04:39,https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2023/oct/theartofperfumeselection_d.jpg,mid_day,4893,india,entertainment,english

The invincible state has shown itself vulnerable, weak, and terribly impotent, which will not go down well for its plans to be a regional leader of a new Middle East.","A few days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a boastful speech at the United Nations, announcing the establishment of a new Middle East centred around Israel and its new Arab partners, the Palestinians, whom he totally omitted from his fantasy regional map, dealt him and Israel a fatal blow, politically and strategically. The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas launched a meticulously planned, well-executed lightning incursion from Gaza into Israel, by air, sea and land. In tandem with thousands of missiles fired towards Israeli targets, hundreds of Palestinian fighters attacked Israeli military and civilian areas in the southern part of the country, which led to the killing of at least 100 Israelis and the capture of dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians as hostages. Hamas’s objectives in the operation are no secret: First, retaliate and punish Israel for its occupation, oppression, illegal settlement, and desecration of Palestinian religious symbols, especially Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem; second, take aim at Arab normalisation with Israel that embraces its apartheid regime in the region; and lastly, secure another prisoner exchange in order to get as many Palestinian political prisoners released from Israeli jails as possible. It is worth recalling that Hamas’s leader in the Gaza Strip, Yahya al-Sinwar, who spent more than two decades in Israeli prison, was released in a prisoner exchange. Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas military arm, like many other Palestinians, lost loved ones to Israeli violence – an infant son, a three-year-old daughter and his wife. Therefore, there is also a clearly a punitive and vengeful aspect to the operation. In that sense, the attack may have been incredibly shocking, but it was hardly surprising. Hubris has finally caught up with Israel and its arrogant leaders, who long thought themselves invincible and repeatedly underestimated their enemies. Since the “surprise” Arab attack of October 1973, successive Israeli leaders have been shocked and awed, again and again, by what the people they oppressed have been capable of. They were caught unprepared by the Lebanese resistance after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, by the Palestinian Intifadas in the 1980s and the 2000s, and by the Palestinian resistance after more than five decades of Israeli occupation and four successive wars on Gaza. Clearly, the Israeli military and civilian leadership also did not expect Hamas’s massive operation, its success representing a major Israeli intelligence and military failure. Despite Israel’s sophisticated network of spies, drones, and surveillance technology, it could not detect and preempt the attack. But the damage done to Israel goes beyond the intelligence and military flop; it is also a political and psychological catastrophe. The invincible state has shown itself vulnerable, weak, and terribly impotent, which will not go down well for its plans to be a regional leader of a new Middle East. Images of Israelis fleeing their homes and towns in fear will be ingrained in their collective memory for many years to come. Today was probably the worst day in Israel’s history. An utter humiliation. Netanyahu, the spin doctor, will not be able to change that regardless of how he spins it. Israel will not get a chance to undo what the world saw on Saturday morning: a frantic country lost to its own fantastical delusions. Israel’s military establishment will no doubt try to recover the strategic and military initiative from Hamas by immediately dealing it a major military blow. As it has done in the past, it will undertake severe bombardment and assassination campaigns, leading to great suffering and countless casualties among the Palestinians. And as it has happened in the past again and again, this will not destroy the Palestinian resistance. That is why, Israel may consider redeploying its military to Palestinian cities, towns and refugee camps across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the pretext of finishing off Hamas and other Palestinian factions. Such a full takeover is the historic wish of the more fanatic members of Israel’s ruling coalition, who want to destroy the Palestinian Authority, take direct control of the entirety of historical Palestine or what they call “The Greater Land of Israel”, and carry out ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. That would be a big mistake. It would lead to a full-fledged asymmetrical war, and in the process, isolate Israel like never before. Even Western leaders, which have thus far supported Netanyahu, expressing more of the same transparently hypocritical solidarity with Israeli apartheid, may begin to distance themselves from the Israeli government. Already, Israel’s scandalous humiliation is undermining its strategic and political standing in the region. Arab regimes that normalised relations with Israel and are partnering with the Netanyahu government appear more foolish with every passing hour. Desperate to reverse his personal failure and maintain his fragile coalition, Netanyahu is sure to overreact, and in the process will alienate more of his new and potential regional partners. Whichever way this goes, Netanyahu’s legacy will be marred by failure. He may well take his Palestinian counterpart, the octogenarian Mahmoud Abbas, along with him down the drain of history. Abbas, too, is failing politically, trying to toe the line between condemning the Israeli occupation and coordinating security with it. Such a balancing act is no longer tenable. But the change that is coming is about more than personalities; it is about the two peoples as a whole, and whether they want to live in peace or die fighting. The time and space for anything in between have passed. The Palestinians have made it clear today that they would rather fight on their feet for justice and freedom than die on their knees in humiliation. It is high time the Israelis heed the lessons of history.",09-10-2023 06:33,,kashmirobserver,596003,india,top,english

Continue reading Paternal leave may safeguard men from alcohol-related illness on Tech Explorist.,"Effects of paternal leave on alcohol morbidity in Sweden. Alcohol-related morbidity poses a significant public health concern worldwide. Studies have consistently demonstrated the detrimental effects of excessive alcohol consumption on individuals’ physical and mental health . While a substantial body of research examines the impact of various factors on alcohol-related morbidity, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential influence of fathers’ parental leave. This study aims to investigate whether taking parental leave can act as a protective factor against alcohol-related morbidity in men, focusing on the context of Sweden. A study conducted by researchers at Stockholm University ‘s Department of Public Health Sciences and published in the journal Addiction has revealed that men who have taken parental leave experience a notable decrease in their likelihood of hospitalization due to alcohol consumption. The primary objective of this study was to examine the potential impact of fathers’ parental leave on alcohol-related morbidity and mortality . To achieve this, the researchers investigated the consequences of a parental leave policy implemented in Sweden 1995. This policy aimed to promote paternal involvement by allocating a dedicated 30-day parental leave allowance exclusively for fathers, leading to a notable increase in fathers’ utilization of parental leave from 43 percent to 75 percent. Helena Honkaniemi, a researcher at the Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University, said, “Our findings were pretty remarkable considering the severity of the studied outcome. Although alcohol-related hospitalizations were uncommon, we found that after the policy was implemented, there was a 34% decrease in these hospitalizations among fathers two years after birth, as well as smaller decreases up to 8 and 18 years after birth.” “Most changes were found among hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication and alcohol-related mental and behavioral disorders. Additional analyses evaluating actual changes in parental leave use from before to after the policy suggest that these health consequences could be explained by the increase in fathers’ parental leave use rather than other underlying trends”, she added. Nevertheless, there were no observable alterations in alcohol-related deaths. Associate Professor Sol Juárez, a co-author of the study, thinks the study’s findings can be valuable for policymakers. Juárez said , “Policymakers should keep in mind that fathers’ parental leave doesn’t just help achieve gender equality in childcare, but it can also lower alcohol-related problems.” The study, “Alcohol-related morbidity and mortality by fathers’ parental leave: A quasi-experimental study in Sweden,” uses data from Sweden on fathers with single children born from January 1992 to December 1997, three years before and after the policy change. This study suggests that fathers’ parental leave might play a role in protecting men against alcohol-related morbidity. As societies evolve and promote shared parenting responsibilities, policies supporting fathers taking extended parental leave may have broader health benefits beyond enhancing family dynamics. Further research and policy initiatives should explore and promote the potential protective effects of fathers’ involvement in caregiving.

The situation has escalated against the backdrop of a sudden and fierce conflict between Israel and the militant organization, Hamas, which has left both nations on edge. Nepal’s Ambassador to Israel, Kanta Rizal, has confirmed the distressing news of the students’ captivity. Tragically, seven of the young scholars have been injured during their ordeal, adding to the gravity of the situation. The conflict that has engulfed Israel began when Hamas , a Palestinian militant group, unleashed an astonishing barrage of 5,000 rockets in a surprise attack. The sheer scale and ferocity of this assault prompted Israel to declare a state of war in response. The toll of this conflict is both heartbreaking and deeply concerning. As of now, over 480 lives have been lost, and countless others have been injured. Families on both sides are enduring unimaginable pain and anguish as they grapple with the consequences of this devastating conflict. The plight of the 17 Nepali students is a poignant reminder of the innocent lives caught in the crossfire of geopolitical conflicts. These young individuals had journeyed to Israel in pursuit of education and a brighter future. However, their dreams have been overshadowed by the harsh reality of being held captive during a time of intense hostilities. The ordeal of these students has sent shockwaves not only through the Nepali and Israeli communities but also across the international stage. Governments, humanitarian organizations, and concerned citizens worldwide are closely following developments and urging for a swift and peaceful resolution to this crisis. The Nepali Ambassador, Kanta Rizal, has been working tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of her compatriots. She has engaged in diplomatic efforts aimed at securing the release of the captive students, all while tending to the needs of those who have been injured. Her dedication to their cause is unwavering, and her resolve to bring them back home unharmed is palpable. Nepal, a nation known for its commitment to peace and diplomacy, has called upon the international community to intervene and help facilitate a peaceful resolution to this crisis. The Nepali government has reiterated its call for the safe release of its citizens and an immediate cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, Israel’s response to the hostage situation has been marked by a heightened sense of urgency and concern. The Israeli government, already grappling with the challenges posed by Hamas’s relentless rocket attacks, is now faced with the added responsibility of ensuring the safety of the captive Nepali students. As the conflict rages on, there is a pressing need for a ceasefire to halt the suffering and loss of life. The toll on both sides is mounting, and the international community’s role in achieving a peaceful resolution cannot be overstated. Diplomatic efforts must be redoubled to bring an end to the violence and create an environment conducive to dialogue and reconciliation. The situation at the Alumim agricultural farm, where the Nepali students are being held, remains tense and precarious. Their families back in Nepal anxiously await news of their loved ones’ safety, clinging to the hope that they will be reunited soon. It is a time of immense uncertainty, fear, and despair for these families, who can only imagine the hardships their children are enduring. In this time of crisis, the world is reminded of the human cost of conflict. Innocent lives are disrupted, dreams are shattered, and futures hang in the balance. It is imperative that all parties involved prioritize the safety and well-being of civilians and take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation. The global community must unite in its call for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Hamas conflict. The lives of 17 Nepali students held captive in a foreign land depend on the swift and coordinated efforts of nations and organizations alike. Their release should serve as a symbol of hope and a testament to the power of diplomacy and compassion in times of turmoil and strife. The plight of the 17 Nepali students has garnered widespread sympathy and support from individuals and organizations around the world. Messages of solidarity and concern have flooded in, reflecting the universal desire for a peaceful resolution to this crisis. It is a stark reminder that in times of conflict, it is the innocent and vulnerable who often bear the brunt of the suffering. The students’ captivity highlights the importance of safeguarding educational opportunities, even in the face of adversity. Education is a fundamental right, and these young scholars had embarked on a journey of knowledge and self-improvement. Their dreams and aspirations should not be derailed by the grim circumstances they now find themselves in. The international community must reaffirm its commitment to protecting educational pursuits, even in conflict zones. As diplomatic efforts continue, there is a glimmer of hope that a resolution can be achieved that ensures the safe return of the Nepali students and a cessation of hostilities in the region. The negotiations are undoubtedly complex, involving multiple stakeholders with differing interests and concerns. Yet, the urgency of the situation demands a concerted and coordinated effort to find common ground and bring an end to the suffering. In the face of this crisis, it is crucial for the global community to come together and redouble its efforts to promote peace and stability in the region. The lives of these 17 Nepali students serve as a powerful reminder that the impact of conflict extends far beyond borders, transcending political, cultural, and national divides. Their release and the resolution of the Israeli-Hamas conflict must be pursued with the utmost urgency, as a testament to humanity’s ability to overcome adversity and forge a path toward peace.",09-10-2023 07:00,,inventiva,703697,india,top,english

In fact, that is how the plate boundaries were first discovered. In the 1950s, when a global seismic network was established to monitor nuclear tests, geophysicists noticed that most earthquakes occur along relatively narrow bands that either fringe the edges of ocean basins, as in the Pacific, or cut right down the middle of basins, as in the Atlantic. iStock Earthquakes , large and small, happen every single day along zones that wrap around the world like seams on a baseball. Most don’t bother anybody, so they don’t make the news. But every now and then a catastrophic earthquake hits people somewhere in the world with horrific destruction and immense suffering. On Oct. 7, 2023, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck near the historic city of Herat , Afghanistan, leaving more than 1,000 people dead in the rubble, according to estimates. It was followed by two more earthquakes, just as powerful, on Oct. 11 and Oct. 15. A few weeks earlier, on Sept. 8, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook ancient villages apart in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco , killing nearly 3,000 people. In February 2023, a large area of Turkey and Syria was devastated by two major earthquakes that hit in close succession. As a geologist, I study the forces that cause earthquakes. Here’s why some seismic zones are very active while others may be quiet for generations before the stress builds into a catastrophic event. Earth ’s crust crashes into itself and pulls apart Earthquakes are part of the normal behavior of the Earth. They occur with the movement of the tectonic plates that form the outer layer of the planet. You can think of the plates as a more or less rigid outer shell that has to shift to allow the Earth to give off its internal heat. These plates carry the continents and the oceans, and they are continuously in slow-motion crashes with one another. The cold and dense oceanic plates dive under continental plates and back into Earth’s mantle in a process known as subduction. As an oceanic plate sinks, it drags everything behind it and opens a rift somewhere else that is filled by rising hot material from the mantle that then cools. These rifts are long chains of underwater volcanoes, known as mid-ocean ridges. Earthquakes accompany both subduction and rifting. In fact, that is how the plate boundaries were first discovered. In the 1950s, when a global seismic network was established to monitor nuclear tests, geophysicists noticed that most earthquakes occur along relatively narrow bands that either fringe the edges of ocean basins, as in the Pacific, or cut right down the middle of basins, as in the Atlantic. They also noticed that earthquakes along subduction zones are shallow on the oceanic side but get deeper under the continent. If you plot the earthquakes in 3D, they define slablike features that trace the plates sinking into the mantle. An experiment: How an earthquake works To understand what happens during an earthquake, put the palms of your hands together and press with some force. You are modeling a plate boundary fault. Each hand is one plate, and the surface of your hands is the fault. Your muscles are the plate tectonic system. Now, add some forward force to your right hand. You will find that it will eventually jerk forward when the forward force overcomes the friction between your palms. That sudden forward jerk is the earthquake. Scientists explain earthquakes using what’s known as the elastic rebound theory. Fast plates move at up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) per year, driven mostly by the oceanic slabs sinking at subduction zones. Over time, they become stuck to each other by friction at the plate boundary. The attempted motion deforms the plate boundary zone elastically, like a loaded spring. At some point, the accumulated elastic energy overcomes the friction and the plate jerks forward, causing an earthquake. But the plate-driving forces do not stop, so the plate boundary starts to accumulate elastic energy again, which will cause another earthquake – perhaps soon or perhaps far in the future. In the oceans, plate boundaries are narrow and well defined because the underlying rocks are very stiff. But within the continents, plate boundaries are often broad zones of deformed mountainous terrain crisscrossed by many faults. Those faults may persist for eons, even if the plate boundary becomes inactive. That is why sometimes earthquakes occur far from plate boundaries. Earthquakes, fast and slow The cyclic behavior of faults allows seismologists to estimate earthquake risks statistically. Plate boundaries with fast motions, such as the ones along the Pacific rim, accumulate elastic energy rapidly and have the potential for frequent large-magnitude earthquakes. Slow-moving plate boundary faults take longer to reach a critical state. Along some faults, hundreds or even thousands of years can pass between large earthquakes. This allows time for towns to grow and for people to lose ancestral memory of past earthquakes. The earthquake in Morocco is an example. Morocco is located on the boundary between the African and the Eurasian plates, which are slowly crashing into each other. The huge belt of mountains that extends from the Atlas of North Africa to the Pyrenees, Alps and most of the mountains across southern Europe and the Middle East is the product of this plate collision. Yet because these plate motions are slow near Morocco, large earthquakes are not so frequent. Afghanistan is more prone to earthquakes. It has numerous faults created by the collision of India against Eurasia. The Indian Plate, which is old and stiff, has been plowing into the southern margin of Eurasia for the past 40 million years. You can see evidence of this slow-moving collision in the way the mountain chains – and the earthquakes – wrap around either side of India. Preparing for the big one An important fact about catastrophic earthquakes is that, in most cases, the earthquakes don’t kill people – falling buildings do. Most Americans have heard of California’s San Andreas Fault and the seismic risk to San Francisco and Los Angeles . The last major earthquake along the San Andreas Fault hit at Loma Prieta , in the San Francisco Bay area , in 1989. Its magnitude, 6.9, was comparable to that of the earthquake in Morocco, yet 63 people died compared with thousands. That’s largely because building codes in these earthquake-prone U.S. cities are now designed to keep structures standing when the Earth shakes. The exceptions are tsunamis, the huge waves generated when an earthquake shifts the seafloor, displacing the water above it. A tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 had horrific consequences, regardless of the quality of engineering in coastal towns. Unfortunately, earthquake scientists can’t predict exactly when an earthquake might occur; they can only estimate the hazard.

The Iranian Foreign Minister singled out the United States for steadfastly supporting Israel following the devastating Hamas attack that claimed over 1,400 Israeli lives. ""If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,"" warned Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, according to Reuters. The relentless Israeli bombardment of Gaza has resulted in the loss of more than 2,670 lives, including over 700 children. Israel severed all essential supplies to the densely populated coastal enclave but recently restored water access to the southern region. Iran emphasized the precariousness of the situation, cautioning that no one can guarantee control and non-expansion of conflicts. They urged those interested in preventing the war's escalation to act against the ongoing brutal attacks targeting citizens and civilians in Gaza. Half a Million Flee to Southern Gaza: IDF Reports In response to Israel's evacuation notice on Friday, approximately half a million people have fled northern Gaza for the south, reported the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson. This estimate accounts for roughly half of the population of northern Gaza, where the IDF is gearing up for the next stages of the conflict with Hamas. The evacuation advisory followed a complete siege imposed by Israel on Gaza. The IDF has allowed safe movement for residents from the northern city of Beit Hanoun to Khan Yunis in the south, a distance of approximately 20 miles through rubble-strewn streets. However, the influx of people has strained southern Gaza's capacity. Shelters are overwhelmed, and the region is grappling with shortages of food, water, and fuel. Israel 'Has No Interest' in Occupying Gaza: UN Ambassador Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, affirmed that Israel has no intention of occupying Gaza but is committed to doing whatever is necessary to eliminate Hamas. He emphasized that Israel does not seek to rule over the lives of over 2 million Palestinians. Rafah Border Crossing Set to Reopen, Says Blinken US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to reopen to facilitate humanitarian aid. This decision followed a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Details of the reopening mechanism were not provided, but it is expected to enable aid to reach those in need. Gaza Hospitals Face Imminent Fuel Shortage, Warns UN Hospitals in Gaza are on the verge of a fuel crisis, with fuel reserves expected to last for only about 24 hours, according to the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA). The shutdown of backup generators due to the fuel shortage jeopardizes the lives of thousands of patients. OCHA also highlighted the heavy and almost uninterrupted Israeli bombardments of Gaza, as well as the ongoing mass displacement of Palestinians. Netanyahu Meets Families Of Hamas Attack Victims In a significant move, Netanyahu met with the families of those who went missing or were held captive during Hamas' assault on Israel. His office shared images of the Prime Minister consoling the relatives, as the families called for the return of their loved ones. This visit followed previous criticism from the families, who accused the government of abandoning those detained in Gaza. In response to a statement by National Security Council chief Tzachi Hanegbi, where he indicated that negotiations with Hamas would not occur, Netanyahu clarified his stance during the meeting with the families. Israel has sent soldiers and tanks to its northern border with Lebanon, which is patrolled by the UN. It has also closed a four-kilometre (2.5-mile) wide area to civilians after deadly fire across the border with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.",16-10-2023 05:00,,zeenews,5319,india,world,english

If I have a holiday, I don’t wake up before 10am. Everyone in my house takes care in a way that they let me sleep because it’s a holiday. When I have to come for shoot in the morning, no matter what you do, you cannot sleep before 12 or 12.30am and then you have to wake up again in the morning so I cannot complete my sleep. You can make me work late at night how much ever you want, that’s not a problem. So firstly when I wake up, I put off my alarm in the first beep and I get out of my bed. I never put my alarm on snooze. Then I have a bottle of water. It’s a digital age but I still read newspaper, just go though the headlines a little and after that I read newspaper later in the day but that’s a different case. Nowadays, I have started intermittent fasting so I have breakfast after coming on the set. Earlier, I used to have my breakfast after drinking water in the morning or my day would go bad but now I have changed my routine. No, I don’t make tea, I just get it. As I said that I’m doing intermittent fasting, I don’t eat after 7.30pm till the next day 9.30am, I mean nothing for 13-14 hours how much ever I can avoid eating. Not too much though, I’m not that rigid and sometimes I cheat. Other than that, I have always been eating clean. I don’t a lot of fried items anyway but I don’t follow any sort of diet. I’m not being able to do gym well because I’m not getting enough time. Sometimes we work for 12-14 hours and come home, after that we have to spend time at home also. However, I have kept weights here and sometimes I do walking on the sets. Sometimes when I feel I’m going too lean, I work out here but I’m not being able to do much, honestly. I am gym and cardio person but I want to start yoga. If I get a good instructor, I would love to join. Also read - This was our conversation with Vijayendra Kumeria.

Guterres warned that Gaza is running out of essential supplies such as water and electricity.,"Synopsis UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on Hamas to release all hostages immediately and for Israel to allow rapid and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip. Guterres warned that Gaza is running out of essential supplies such as water and electricity. ANI UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN chief Antonio Guterres has called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages without conditions and urged Israel to allow rapid and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid for civilians in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, home to about 2.3 million people, is under a total blockade. Israel has cut off all supplies of food, water and fuel in the wake of ongoing hostilities with Palestinian militant group Hamas. On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it would impose a ""complete siege"" on the territory. ""In this dramatic moment, as we are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East, it is my duty as Secretary-General of the United Nations to make two strong humanitarian appeals,"" Guterres said here in a statement on Sunday. The UN Secretary-General appealed to Hamas that it must release all hostages immediately without conditions. ""To Israel, rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid must be granted for humanitarian supplies and workers for the sake of the civilians in Gaza,"" Guterres said. ""Each one of these two objectives is valid in themselves. They should not become bargaining chips and they must be implemented because it is the right thing to do,"" he said. The UN chief sounded a dire warning, saying: ""Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies."" He noted that the United Nations has stocks available of food, water, non-food items, medical supplies and fuel, located in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel and these goods can be dispatched within hours. ""To ensure delivery, our selfless staff on the ground, along with NGO partners, need to be able to bring these supplies into and throughout Gaza safely, and without impediment to deliver to those in need,"" Guterres said. The United Nations, along with other humanitarian agencies, has been working round the clock to preposition aid since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out following the militant group's October 7 assault on several locations inside Israel and Israel's subsequent declaration of war. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Sunday that heavy Israeli bombardments on Gaza, from the air, sea and land, have continued almost uninterrupted. Over the past 24 hours, there have been 455 Palestinian fatalities in Gaza and 856 injuries, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Following Israel's ultimatum on Friday that Palestinians in Gaza should relocate to the strip's south, OCHA said that by Saturday afternoon, nearly 600,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) were hosted in the central and southern parts of Gaza alone, in increasingly dire conditions. It added that since then, this figure has risen significantly. About 300,000 people are situated in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's (UNRWA) designated emergency shelters, and the rest in public facilities and with host families. The OCHA said an almost full evacuation of Sderot city, in southern Israel, was completed on Sunday. Smaller Israeli communities around Gaza have been fully vacated in previous days, while a large proportion of Ashqelon City's residents have also reportedly left. The UN agency added that since the start of hostilities, 2,670 Palestinians have been killed and 9,600 have been injured. The fatality toll in Gaza during the eight days of hostilities has already surpassed the total number of fatalities during the 2014 escalation, which lasted for over seven weeks (2,251 Palestinian fatalities). According to the Palestinian Civil Defense, the number of missing people, presumably trapped beneath the rubble may exceed 1,000. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that as of October 15, 47 families were killed, amounting to about 500 people.

ANI Samajwadi Party leader Swami Prasad Maurya on Saturday said that India and Pakistan were divided because the Hindu Mahasabha demanded two nations, not Jinnah . Talking to the media, in UP's Banda, the Samajwadi Party leader said that the people who are talking of a Hindu Rashtra are the enemies of the nation. ""The Indian Constitution says that there cannot be any discrimination on the basis of faith, caste, gender or birthplace. If a Hindu speaks of a Hindu Rashtra, why won't others? People talking of Hindu Rashtra are enemies of the nation,"" Maurya said. ""Hindu Mahasabha spoke of Hindu Rashtra a long time ago which resulted in the formation of India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan were not divided because of Jinnah, they were divided because the Hindu Mahasabha demanded two nations,"" the Samajwadi Party leader added. Notably, in August also SP leader Maurya faced backlash over his remarks on the Hindu religion. ""The roots of Brahminism are very deep and the reason for all the disparity is also Brahminism itself. There is no religion called Hindu, Hinduism is just a hoax,"" Swami Prasad Maurya earlier in a post on X said. Reacting to this, Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam said that abusing Hindus has become a fashion and SP leader Maurya has crossed the limits. ""Abusing Hindus has become a fashion and SP leader Maurya has crossed the limits. Every day wherever he goes, he insults the Hindu religion. This time he has done wonders by saying that there is no religion called Hindu and Akhilesh ji is silent on this. I think the Samajwadi Party don't need Hindus and their votes now, this is very unfortunate,"" Acharya Pramod told ANI. ""I think Akhilesh Yadav should now bid farewell to Swami Prasad Maurya or otherwise it will be very bad for him and the party,"" Acharya Pramod added. Meanwhile, Supreme Court Advocate Vineet Jindal also filed a complaint in August this year with Delhi Police against SP leader Swami Prasad Maurya over his remarks on the Hindu religion. The lawyer said that the statements made by SP leader Maurya were provocative and defamatory with the intent to promote enmity between groups on the grounds of religion and a cognizable offence.

During Israel's third war against Hamas in 2014, the densely populated neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City became a battleground. Despite warnings to leave, many civilians stayed, resulting in heavy casualties. NYT News Service A soldier sits on a bench with a rifle in his lap in Israel A battle that killed dozens of civilians and more than a dozen Israeli soldiers nearly a decade ago offers a glimpse of the type of fighting that could lie ahead if Israeli forces roll into Gaza as expected to punish Hamas for its rampage across southern Israel last week. It was July 19, 2014, during Israel's third war against Hamas. The target was Shijaiyah, a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza City that the army said Hamas had transformed into a “terrorist fortress,” filled with tunnels, rocket launchers and booby traps. The battle came on the third day of a ground offensive that had been preceded by a 10-day air campaign. Then, as now, Palestinian civilians had been told to leave the neighborhood, Then, as now, many stayed, either because Hamas told them to or because they had nowhere else to go. As Israeli forces pushed into Shijaiyah, a jumble of squat concrete buildings and narrow alleys, militants unleashed a withering barrage of automatic gunfire, anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades, the army said at the time. An armored personnel carrier broke down. When two soldiers got out to fix it, a militant fired an anti-tank missile at the vehicle, blowing it up and killing all seven soldiers inside. In the ensuing chaos, Hamas fighters managed to drag away the remains of one of the soldiers and are still holding them.

The next day, Israeli warplanes dropped 100 one-ton bombs on the area, Israeli media reported later. “The gate of hell has opened, and shrapnel came through the windows,” a Palestinian resident told the AP at the time. In 2014, “there was a feeling of craziness in how much fire was used,” an Israeli soldier told Breaking the Silence, a group of veterans who are critical of Israel’s policies and collect anonymous testimony from soldiers. Fifty-five civilians were killed during the two-day battle, including 19 children and 14 women, a U.N. report found, as well as an unknown number of militants. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were killed. You Might Also Like: UN Security Council in talks on resolution on Israel-Hamas war Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli general who was serving alongside top commanders during the 2014 battle, said this time would be “completely different,” because the artillery and airstrikes will come first. “It will be a massive maneuver with a lot of air and artillery — a very, very strong entrance. We’re going to try to minimize as much as possible our troops’ casualties, and for this, we need a lot of cover.” He said less firepower would be needed if it is used at the start and not when soldiers are in distress. The tremendous firepower may have stemmed the army's losses, but it took a heavy toll on civilians and flattened much of the neighborhood. Some 670 buildings were destroyed and nearly 1,200 were moderately to severely damaged, the U.N. report said. Investigators counted 270 craters. “It's a hell of a pinpoint operation,” then-Secretary of State John Kerry said sarcastically about the battle, in a moment caught on a hot mic. You Might Also Like: Israel-Palestine War: In timeline of attacks in Israel, wait for help seemed to be endless Israel has ordered an unprecedented evacuation of nearly half of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians from the northern part of the besieged territory to the south. Avivi, the retired general, said that is intended to spare them. But not everyone is able or willing to flee. “When the artillery will start, those who haven’t evacuated yet will evacuate,” he said. The U.N. report found ""strong indications"" that the Shijaiyah operation involved indiscriminate fire that ""may amount to a war crime."" The International Criminal Court is investigating possible war crimes committed by both sides during the 2014 war. Israel, which has long accused U.N. bodies of being biased against it, refused to cooperate with either probe. The war continued for more than a month after Shijaiyah, through similarly destructive battles. It ended with a shaky truce and Hamas still firmly in control despite the deaths of 2,251 Palestinians — mostly civilians — and widespread destruction. On the Israeli side, 74 people were killed, including six civilians. In 2021 the two sides fought another devastating war, though there was no ground invasion. And then on Saturday, a still unbowed Hamas stormed out of Gaza and rampaged through southern Israel, killing hundreds and dragging some 150 hostages back into the narrow, coastal territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was also in power in 2014, has vowed to destroy Hamas. The group's leaders say they are prepared for all scenarios. Israel has promised a “very broad” air, ground and naval offensive in the near future. It has massed tanks and tens of thousands of troops along the Gaza border. If they move in, Shijaiyah will be among their first targets. Print Edition Monday, 16 Oct, 2023 Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!
