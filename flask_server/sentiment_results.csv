the world of perfumery offers extensive options Some gravitate towards the warm comforting fragrances others might prefer lively tones How do you determine which scent truly resonates with you Read to find out In a world where fragrance has the power to evoke emotions choosing the right one can be daunting From earthy scents to zesty aromas the offers an extensive array of fragrances The subtleties of personal preference occasion and season can all play a significant role in the selection process adding to the complexity of the decision Some may gravitate towards the warm comforting embrace of woody fragrances while others might prefer the lively and uplifting tones of citrus scents While some may find themselves captivated by the sweet fruity notes that whisk them away to faroff orchards In the midst of this aromatic abundance the question arises How do you determine which scent truly resonates with you Fret not There is a way to select the fragrance that perfectly complements your personality style and mood To navigate this olfactory journey Midday sat down with experienced perfumers  Ridhima Kansal and Vidushi Vijayvergiya who shed light on the nuances of selecting the  There are innumerable fragrance profiles made from a mix of natural elements and synthesised molecules A perfumer generally works with around  different ingredients while developing fragrances Based on the brief we blend ingredients to present the idea in a harmonious way remarks Vidushi Vijayvergiya the founder and CEO of ISAK Fragrances Fragrances are divided into several main families each with a unique scent and distinct combination Ridhima Kansal the director of the UKbased home fragrance brand  Rosemoore shares major fragrance groups along with their characteristics Floral This category refers to the fragrance of freshly plucked flowers For instance Rose Jasmine Gardenia Lily and more Fruity Fruity fragrance is derived from the aroma of fruits including berries peaches and apples Lively and playful these scents add a youthful touch to the wearer Spicy This consists of warm aromatic ingredients like nutmeg clove and cinnamon Its usually worn in colder seasons to exude warmth and fragrance Citrusy This is dominated by zesty and refreshing citrus fruits like lemon orange and grapefruit which not only uplifts the mood but creates a fresh ambiance Woody This family contains earthy woody scents like vetiver sandalwood and cedarwood which evoke a sense of ambient nature that is soothing to the senses These fragrance families provide a system for classifying fragrances based on their core characteristics but they blend many contemporary fragrances incorporating elements from different categories to create unique and multifaceted olfactory experiences Kansal reveals the one should opt for depending upon the season For spring and summer seasons  fresh especially flowery or citrus fragrances are best These scents produce a positive mood by capturing the liveliness and vibrancy of these seasons In the winter season  warm spicy and woody fragrances are preferable as they induce a soothing and inviting aura that pairs well with the chilly weather The season and weather play an important role in determining the fragrance one intends to wear remarks Vijayvergia As per Indian heritage and Vedas we should use cooling and fresh ingredientsbased perfumes during the summers Some such ingredients are Vetiver rose rajnigandha sandalwood and mitti During winters  we can go for warmerwoody fragrances with notes like amber Oudh Vanilla Resins and Patchouli Based on the type of occasion one can decide the relevant fragrance to wear For an office day wear subtle perfumes that are also fresh and longlasting Patchouli Sandalwood and Cedarwood These sophisticated earthy scents are appropriate for both formal and informal settings since they exude a feeling of grounding and elegance Vijayvergia advises against wearing strong Oudhfocused perfumes to the office Although a strong Oudhbased perfume could be a great extension of ones personality as an evening party wear Additionally citrus and floral perfumes are suitable for fun dates adventure activities and day picnics Apple mango and blackberry are fruity scents that are playful and youngsmelling adding an energising touch and making them ideal for daytime wear Rose jasmine and lavender are floral These timeless enduring scents are preferred for special occasions or private situations because they radiate elegance and passion These notes help uplift our moods with sublime fragrance profiles and induce faint wellness The role of layering to sustain the fragrance We all crave a longlasting fragrance but generally dont end up with one Perfumers share tricks to sustain the aroma with handy tips As a general rule of thumb heavier scents like woody should be sprayed first so they dont overpower their lighter counterparts like citruses shares Vijayvergia Always apply fragrances on pulse points like the wrist neck etc and allow it some time to develop and settle down Keep noticing how it changes and interacts with the odour of your skin The concentration of fragrance is directly proportional to longevity Hence for a longlasting fragrance choose a higherconcentration fragrance Also using scents on wellmoisturised skin enhances the longevity of the fragrance because of the hydrated base to which the scent adheres Layering scents can do wonders Apply a nonscented moisturiser after shower and then spray your preferred perfumes Or you can spray one scent on your wrists and another on your neck Play around with different combinations and dont be afraid to experiment To enhance longevity and create a multidimensional fragrance sensation use complementary scented items like shower gel and lotion adds Kansal Layering complementary fragrances like floral and citrus will help you create a unique and individualised perfume that will reflect your personality and style There are a few ways you can approach layering The easiest is to find a fairly unfussy fragrance that is already built around musk or typical base notes like vanilla Add to it something with more complexity on top to create an appealing mix Another option is to use a singlenote perfume under or over an existing scent A fragrance contains many key components that interact in harmony to create a unique and memorable fragrance Key features include Top notes The first volatile scents that are perceived upon application Heart Middle notes After the disappearance of top notes heart notes form the core of the fragrance Base notes Deep longlasting scents that emerge after the heart notes and serve to anchor the fragrance The interaction of these elements and part of their blend determines the fragrances unique olfactory experience Top notes draw heart notes define and base notes linger creating a multidimensional and evolving fragrance that makes each fragrance unique Picking a fragrance depends on ones personal style and the occasion  formal informal or casual Additionally skin type and pH balance are other factors that influence how a scent interacts with ones skin and affects its development and longevity shares Kansal Therefore selecting scents requires an understanding of your skin Here are some guidelines to help you choose the most suitable fragrance according to your skin type If you have normal skin youre in luck because most fragrances tend to work well on your skin You have the flexibility to choose a wide range of scents from light and fresh to rich and complex Floral fruity woody and citrus fragrances should all work harmoniously with your skin type Dry skin has less natural moisture which can cause fragrances to evaporate more quickly Opt for fragrances with richer oilbased formulations such as perfume oils Eau de Parfum EDP or parfum concentrations Woody and oriental scents with deeper lingering notes can work well with dry skin as they tend to last longer Oily skin tends to retain fragrances longer which means you may not need as much or as heavy a fragrance Light fresh and citrusy scents are great choices to counterbalance the natural oiliness of your skin Eau de Toilette EDT or lighter concentrations can work well for oily skin types Sensitive skin can sometimes react to fragrances due to the alcohol or other ingredients in perfumes Its advisable to choose fragrancefree or hypoallergenic options If you still want to wear scents consider applying a minimal amount of a fragrancefree moisturiser or unscented body oil to create a barrier between your skin and the perfume If your skin is a combination of oily and dry areas consider applying a fragranceneutral moisturiser to balance out the skins moisture levels before applying your perfume This will help the fragrance distribute more evenly and last longer As skin ages it tends to become drier Opt for fragrances with heavier richer bases such as woody oriental or gourmand scents as they can work well with ageing skin Perfume oils and Eau de Parfum EDP are excellent choices for a longerlasting scent Its important to consider the pH balance of ones skin when choosing a fragrance because its directly linked with the impact on how a fragrance reacts with your skin Testing fragrance on your inner elbow or wrist will help you determine compatibility Harmonious balance can be ensured by using testers or samples which will help determine how a fragrance interacts with your particular skin chemistry Identifying your favourite scent often referred to as your scent personality can be a fun and personal journey Here are some ways shared by the perfumers to find your preference  Try different fragrance categories to find which one appeals the most Pay attention to the emotional response each aroma evokes  Try the perfume on scent strips Once shortlisted try the fragrance on our skin Specifically at the pulse points This will help you understand how the perfume will smell on you  Think about the fragrance in common items like soaps or lotions that you naturally prefer Finding your signature perfume can be done by starting with these preferences  Think about any memory or emotion that you associate with a specific fragrance Often some fragrances that bring back cherished memories match your fragrance characteristics  There are multiple quizzes that are based on the science of synaesthesia the production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the body One can take a perfume quiz online to find their scent profile Vijayvergiya shares a connection between ones personality and fragrance profile If your radiant energy high spirits and a heart of gold reveal your inner beauty  your right brain is devoted to soft lines and natural colours Floral and fruity perfumes are not only your favourite but they also enhance your virtuosity and loveliness Remember there are no rights or wrongs when it comes to fragrance Your scent personality is a unique reflection of your own tastes and experiences so embrace the scent that makes you feel good,16-10-2023

group of  Nepali students find themselves in the midst of a harrowing hostage situation at an agricultural farm in Alumim  Israel The situation has escalated against the backdrop of a sudden and fierce conflict between Israel and the militant organization Hamas which has left both nations on edge Nepals Ambassador to Israel Kanta Rizal has confirmed the distressing news of the students captivity Tragically seven of the young scholars have been injured during their ordeal adding to the gravity of the situation The conflict that has engulfed Israel began when Hamas  a Palestinian militant group unleashed an astonishing barrage of  rockets in a surprise attack The sheer scale and ferocity of this assault prompted Israel to declare a state of war in response The toll of this conflict is both heartbreaking and deeply concerning As of now over  lives have been lost and countless others have been injured Families on both sides are enduring unimaginable pain and anguish as they grapple with the consequences of this devastating conflict The plight of the  Nepali students is a poignant reminder of the innocent lives caught in the crossfire of geopolitical conflicts These young individuals had journeyed to Israel in pursuit of education and a brighter future However their dreams have been overshadowed by the harsh reality of being held captive during a time of intense hostilities The ordeal of these students has sent shockwaves not only through the Nepali and Israeli communities but also across the international stage Governments humanitarian organizations and concerned citizens worldwide are closely following developments and urging for a swift and peaceful resolution to this crisis The Nepali Ambassador Kanta Rizal has been working tirelessly to ensure the safety and wellbeing of her compatriots She has engaged in diplomatic efforts aimed at securing the release of the captive students all while tending to the needs of those who have been injured Her dedication to their cause is unwavering and her resolve to bring them back home unharmed is palpable Nepal a nation known for its commitment to peace and diplomacy has called upon the international community to intervene and help facilitate a peaceful resolution to this crisis The Nepali government has reiterated its call for the safe release of its citizens and an immediate cessation of hostilities Meanwhile Israels response to the hostage situation has been marked by a heightened sense of urgency and concern The Israeli government already grappling with the challenges posed by Hamass relentless rocket attacks is now faced with the added responsibility of ensuring the safety of the captive Nepali students As the conflict rages on there is a pressing need for a ceasefire to halt the suffering and loss of life The toll on both sides is mounting and the international communitys role in achieving a peaceful resolution cannot be overstated Diplomatic efforts must be redoubled to bring an end to the violence and create an environment conducive to dialogue and reconciliation The situation at the Alumim agricultural farm where the Nepali students are being held remains tense and precarious Their families back in Nepal anxiously await news of their loved ones safety clinging to the hope that they will be reunited soon It is a time of immense uncertainty fear and despair for these families who can only imagine the hardships their children are enduring In this time of crisis the world is reminded of the human cost of conflict Innocent lives are disrupted dreams are shattered and futures hang in the balance It is imperative that all parties involved prioritize the safety and wellbeing of civilians and take immediate steps to deescalate the situation The global community must unite in its call for a peaceful resolution to the IsraeliHamas conflict The lives of  Nepali students held captive in a foreign land depend on the swift and coordinated efforts of nations and organizations alike Their release should serve as a symbol of hope and a testament to the power of diplomacy and compassion in times of turmoil and strife The plight of the  Nepali students has garnered widespread sympathy and support from individuals and organizations around the world Messages of solidarity and concern have flooded in reflecting the universal desire for a peaceful resolution to this crisis It is a stark reminder that in times of conflict it is the innocent and vulnerable who often bear the brunt of the suffering The students captivity highlights the importance of safeguarding educational opportunities even in the face of adversity Education is a fundamental right and these young scholars had embarked on a journey of knowledge and selfimprovement Their dreams and aspirations should not be derailed by the grim circumstances they now find themselves in The international community must reaffirm its commitment to protecting educational pursuits even in conflict zones As diplomatic efforts continue there is a glimmer of hope that a resolution can be achieved that ensures the safe return of the Nepali students and a cessation of hostilities in the region The negotiations are undoubtedly complex involving multiple stakeholders with differing interests and concerns Yet the urgency of the situation demands a concerted and coordinated effort to find common ground and bring an end to the suffering In the face of this crisis it is crucial for the global community to come together and redouble its efforts to promote peace and stability in the region The lives of these  Nepali students serve as a powerful reminder that the impact of conflict extends far beyond borders transcending political cultural and national divides Their release and the resolution of the IsraeliHamas conflict must be pursued with the utmost urgency as a testament to humanitys ability to overcome adversity and forge a path toward

The invincible state has shown itself vulnerable, weak, and terribly impotent, which will not go down well for its plans to be a regional leader of a new Middle East.",A few days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a boastful speech at the United Nations announcing the establishment of a new Middle East centred around Israel and its new Arab partners the Palestinians whom he totally omitted from his fantasy regional map dealt him and Israel a fatal blow politically and strategically The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas launched a meticulously planned wellexecuted lightning incursion from Gaza into Israel by air sea and land In tandem with thousands of missiles fired towards Israeli targets hundreds of Palestinian fighters attacked Israeli military and civilian areas in the southern part of the country which led to the killing of at least  Israelis and the capture of dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians as hostages Hamass objectives in the operation are no secret First retaliate and punish Israel for its occupation oppression illegal settlement and desecration of Palestinian religious symbols especially AlAqsa Mosque in Jerusalem second take aim at Arab normalisation with Israel that embraces its apartheid regime in the region and lastly secure another prisoner exchange in order to get as many Palestinian political prisoners released from Israeli jails as possible It is worth recalling that Hamass leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya alSinwar who spent more than two decades in Israeli prison was released in a prisoner exchange Mohammed Deif the head of Hamas military arm like many other Palestinians lost loved ones to Israeli violence  an infant son a threeyearold daughter and his wife Therefore there is also a clearly a punitive and vengeful aspect to the operation In that sense the attack may have been incredibly shocking but it was hardly surprising Hubris has finally caught up with Israel and its arrogant leaders who long thought themselves invincible and repeatedly underestimated their enemies Since the surprise Arab attack of October  successive Israeli leaders have been shocked and awed again and again by what the people they oppressed have been capable of They were caught unprepared by the Lebanese resistance after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in  by the Palestinian Intifadas in the s and the s and by the Palestinian resistance after more than five decades of Israeli occupation and four successive wars on Gaza Clearly the Israeli military and civilian leadership also did not expect Hamass massive operation its success representing a major Israeli intelligence and military failure Despite Israels sophisticated network of spies drones and surveillance technology it could not detect and preempt the attack But the damage done to Israel goes beyond the intelligence and military flop it is also a political and psychological catastrophe The invincible state has shown itself vulnerable weak and terribly impotent which will not go down well for its plans to be a regional leader of a new Middle East Images of Israelis fleeing their homes and towns in fear will be ingrained in their collective memory for many years to come Today was probably the worst day in Israels history An utter humiliation Netanyahu the spin doctor will not be able to change that regardless of how he spins it Israel will not get a chance to undo what the world saw on Saturday morning a frantic country lost to its own fantastical delusions Israels military establishment will no doubt try to recover the strategic and military initiative from Hamas by immediately dealing it a major military blow As it has done in the past it will undertake severe bombardment and assassination campaigns leading to great suffering and countless casualties among the Palestinians And as it has happened in the past again and again this will not destroy the Palestinian resistance That is why Israel may consider redeploying its military to Palestinian cities towns and refugee camps across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the pretext of finishing off Hamas and other Palestinian factions Such a full takeover is the historic wish of the more fanatic members of Israels ruling coalition who want to destroy the Palestinian Authority take direct control of the entirety of historical Palestine or what they call The Greater Land of Israel and carry out ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians That would be a big mistake It would lead to a fullfledged asymmetrical war and in the process isolate Israel like never before Even Western leaders which have thus far supported Netanyahu expressing more of the same transparently hypocritical solidarity with Israeli apartheid may begin to distance themselves from the Israeli government Already Israels scandalous humiliation is undermining its strategic and political standing in the region Arab regimes that normalised relations with Israel and are partnering with the Netanyahu government appear more foolish with every passing hour Desperate to reverse his personal failure and maintain his fragile coalition Netanyahu is sure to overreact and in the process will alienate more of his new and potential regional partners Whichever way this goes Netanyahus legacy will be marred by failure He may well take his Palestinian counterpart the octogenarian Mahmoud Abbas along with him down the drain of history Abbas too is failing politically trying to toe the line between condemning the Israeli occupation and coordinating security with it Such a balancing act is no longer tenable But the change that is coming is about more than personalities it is about the two peoples as a whole and whether they want to live in peace or die fighting The time and space for anything in between have passed The Palestinians have made it clear today that they would rather fight on their feet for justice and freedom than die on their knees in humiliation It is high time the Israelis heed the lessons of history,09-10-2023 06:33,,kashmirobserver,596003,india,top,english

In fact, that is how the plate boundaries were first discovered. In the 1950s, when a global seismic network was established to monitor nuclear tests, geophysicists noticed that most earthquakes occur along relatively narrow bands that either fringe the edges of ocean basins, as in the Pacific, or cut right down the middle of basins, as in the Atlantic.",Synopsis Earthquakes accompany both subduction and rifting In fact that is how the plate boundaries were first discovered In the s when a global seismic network was established to monitor nuclear tests geophysicists noticed that most earthquakes occur along relatively narrow bands that either fringe the edges of ocean basins as in the Pacific or cut right down the middle of basins as in the Atlantic iStock Earthquakes  large and small happen every single day along zones that wrap around the world like seams on a baseball Most dont bother anybody so they dont make the news But every now and then a catastrophic earthquake hits people somewhere in the world with horrific destruction and immense suffering On Oct   a  magnitude earthquake struck near the historic city of Herat  Afghanistan leaving more than  people dead in the rubble according to estimates It was followed by two more earthquakes just as powerful on Oct  and Oct  A few weeks earlier on Sept  a  magnitude earthquake shook ancient villages apart in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco  killing nearly  people In February  a large area of Turkey and Syria was devastated by two major earthquakes that hit in close succession As a geologist I study the forces that cause earthquakes Heres why some seismic zones are very active while others may be quiet for generations before the stress builds into a catastrophic event Earth s crust crashes into itself and pulls apart Earthquakes are part of the normal behavior of the Earth They occur with the movement of the tectonic plates that form the outer layer of the planet You can think of the plates as a more or less rigid outer shell that has to shift to allow the Earth to give off its internal heat These plates carry the continents and the oceans and they are continuously in slowmotion crashes with one another The cold and dense oceanic plates dive under continental plates and back into Earths mantle in a process known as subduction As an oceanic plate sinks it drags everything behind it and opens a rift somewhere else that is filled by rising hot material from the mantle that then cools These rifts are long chains of underwater volcanoes known as midocean ridges Earthquakes accompany both subduction and rifting In fact that is how the plate boundaries were first discovered In the s when a global seismic network was established to monitor nuclear tests geophysicists noticed that most earthquakes occur along relatively narrow bands that either fringe the edges of ocean basins as in the Pacific or cut right down the middle of basins as in the Atlantic They also noticed that earthquakes along subduction zones are shallow on the oceanic side but get deeper under the continent If you plot the earthquakes in D they define slablike features that trace the plates sinking into the mantle An experiment How an earthquake works To understand what happens during an earthquake put the palms of your hands together and press with some force You are modeling a plate boundary fault Each hand is one plate and the surface of your hands is the fault Your muscles are the plate tectonic system Now add some forward force to your right hand You will find that it will eventually jerk forward when the forward force overcomes the friction between your palms That sudden forward jerk is the earthquake Scientists explain earthquakes using whats known as the elastic rebound theory Fast plates move at up to  inches  centimeters per year driven mostly by the oceanic slabs sinking at subduction zones Over time they become stuck to each other by friction at the plate boundary The attempted motion deforms the plate boundary zone elastically like a loaded spring At some point the accumulated elastic energy overcomes the friction and the plate jerks forward causing an earthquake But the platedriving forces do not stop so the plate boundary starts to accumulate elastic energy again which will cause another earthquake  perhaps soon or perhaps far in the future In the oceans plate boundaries are narrow and well defined because the underlying rocks are very stiff But within the continents plate boundaries are often broad zones of deformed mountainous terrain crisscrossed by many faults Those faults may persist for eons even if the plate boundary becomes inactive That is why sometimes earthquakes occur far from plate boundaries Earthquakes fast and slow The cyclic behavior of faults allows seismologists to estimate earthquake risks statistically Plate boundaries with fast motions such as the ones along the Pacific rim accumulate elastic energy rapidly and have the potential for frequent largemagnitude earthquakes Slowmoving plate boundary faults take longer to reach a critical state Along some faults hundreds or even thousands of years can pass between large earthquakes This allows time for towns to grow and for people to lose ancestral memory of past earthquakes The earthquake in Morocco is an example Morocco is located on the boundary between the African and the Eurasian plates which are slowly crashing into each other The huge belt of mountains that extends from the Atlas of North Africa to the Pyrenees Alps and most of the mountains across southern Europe and the Middle East is the product of this plate collision Yet because these plate motions are slow near Morocco large earthquakes are not so frequent Afghanistan is more prone to earthquakes It has numerous faults created by the collision of India against Eurasia The Indian Plate which is old and stiff has been plowing into the southern margin of Eurasia for the past  million years You can see evidence of this slowmoving collision in the way the mountain chains  and the earthquakes  wrap around either side of India Preparing for the big one An important fact about catastrophic earthquakes is that in most cases the earthquakes dont kill people  falling buildings do Most Americans have heard of Californias San Andreas Fault and the seismic risk to San Francisco and Los Angeles  The last major earthquake along the San Andreas Fault hit at Loma Prieta  in the San Francisco Bay area  in  Its magnitude  was comparable to that of the earthquake in Morocco yet  people died compared with thousands Thats largely because building codes in these earthquakeprone US cities are now designed to keep structures standing when the Earth shakes The exceptions are tsunamis the huge waves generated when an earthquake shifts the seafloor displacing the water above it A tsunami that hit Japan in  had horrific consequences regardless of the quality of engineering in coastal towns Unfortunately earthquake scientists cant predict exactly

SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres UN chief Antonio Guterres has called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages without conditions and urged Israel to allow rapid and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid for civilians in the Gaza Strip The Hamasruled Gaza Strip home to about  million people is under a total blockade Israel has cut off all supplies of food water and fuel in the wake of ongoing hostilities with Palestinian militant group Hamas On Monday Israels Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it would impose a complete siege on the territory In this dramatic moment as we are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East it is my duty as SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations to make two strong humanitarian appeals Guterres said here in a statement on Sunday The UN SecretaryGeneral appealed to Hamas that it must release all hostages immediately without conditions To Israel rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid must be granted for humanitarian supplies and workers for the sake of the civilians in Gaza Guterres said Each one of these two objectives is valid in themselves They should not become bargaining chips and they must be implemented because it is the right thing to do he said The UN chief sounded a dire warning saying Gaza is running out of water electricity and other essential supplies He noted that the United Nations has stocks available of food water nonfood items medical supplies and fuel located in Egypt Jordan the West Bank and Israel and these goods can be dispatched within hours To ensure delivery our selfless staff on the ground along with NGO partners need to be able to bring these supplies into and throughout Gaza safely and without impediment to deliver to those in need Guterres said The United Nations along with other humanitarian agencies has been working round the clock to preposition aid since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out following the militant groups October  assault on several

into the type of fighting that may occur During Israels third war against Hamas in  the densely populated neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City became a battleground Despite warnings to leave many civilians stayed resulting in heavy casualties NYT News Service A soldier sits on a bench with a rifle in his lap in Israel A battle that killed dozens of civilians and more than a dozen Israeli soldiers nearly a decade ago offers a glimpse of the type of fighting that could lie ahead if Israeli forces roll into Gaza as expected to punish Hamas for its rampage across southern Israel last week It was July   during Israels third war against Hamas The target was Shijaiyah a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza City that the army said Hamas had transformed into a terrorist fortress filled with tunnels rocket launchers and booby traps The battle came on the third day of a ground offensive that had been preceded by a day air campaign Then as now Palestinian civilians had been told to leave the neighborhood Then as now many stayed either because Hamas told them to or because they had nowhere else to go As Israeli forces pushed into Shijaiyah a jumble of squat concrete buildings and narrow alleys militants unleashed a withering barrage of automatic gunfire antitank missiles and rocketpropelled grenades the army said at the time An armored personnel carrier broke down When two soldiers got out to fix it a militant fired an antitank missile at the vehicle blowing it up and killing all seven soldiers inside In the ensuing chaos Hamas fighters managed to drag away the remains of one of the soldiers and are still holding them You Might Also Like One million Gazans flee as Israel readies for ground attack In the panicked aftermath soldiers were ordered to climb into their

Israeli general who was serving alongside top commanders during the  battle said this time would be completely different because the artillery and airstrikes will come first It will be a massive maneuver with a lot of air and artillery  a very very strong entrance Were going to try to minimize as much as possible our troops casualties and for this we need a lot of cover He said less firepower would be needed if it is used at the start and not when soldiers are in distress The tremendous firepower may have stemmed the armys losses but it took a heavy toll on civilians and flattened much of the neighborhood Some  buildings were destroyed and nearly  were moderately to severely damaged the UN report said Investigators counted  craters Its a hell of a pinpoint operation thenSecretary of

has ordered an unprecedented evacuation of nearly half of Gazas  million Palestinians from the northern part of the besieged territory to the south Avivi the retired general said that is intended to

operation involved indiscriminate fire that may amount to a war crime The International Criminal Court is investigating possible war crimes committed by both sides during the  war Israel which has long accused UN bodies of being biased against it refused to cooperate with either probe The war continued for more than a month after Shijaiyah through similarly destructive battles It ended with a shaky truce and Hamas still firmly in control despite the deaths of  Palestinians  mostly civilians  and widespread destruction On the Israeli side  people were killed including six civilians In  the two sides fought another devastating war though there was no ground invasion And then on Saturday a still unbowed Hamas stormed out of Gaza and rampaged through southern Israel killing hundreds and dragging some  hostages back into the narrow coastal territory Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was also in power in  has vowed to destroy Hamas The groups leaders say they are prepared
